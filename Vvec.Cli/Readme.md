# Features to work on

* Config
	* I've got some basic config set up, and plans for a few more validated types, but it might be good to add in some collection type stuff. For Prj I'm thinking that we'll want to have collections of key/value pairs to support the known folder stuff...
	* Maybe have a way to validate config fields in commands that use them to keep it consistent. When you run a command, it can specify which args it'll need to be good...
* SourceGenning IoC
	* This looks very in-depth. We have the current CLI app source to look at, but if we need to register classes from other libraries, we'll need to mix source genning with reflection, and it'll be a palaver. 
* Command types
	* Currently I've done all multiple sub-command stuff, but for prj I'd want to have no args fire off the default command, but still be able to do the config subcommand if that's chosen...
		* I don't think that there is the concept of a "default" command in System.CommandLine, so maybe if only a single command is registered, the config should be set as an extra arg thingy, eg. prj --config key value or somefink...
		* Or, maybe we could do a quick inspect of the args[] and decide what gets registered based on that...
		* Could have a different Register method for subcommand vs single command. Either based on the method name, or have another type alongside ISubCommand...

* Help Output
	* The Usage section displays the full app name, this should be overridable in the EntryPoint ctor or some method on it at least.
