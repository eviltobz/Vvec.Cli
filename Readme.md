# App Ideas

## Project Navigator
Build on my Dyn 'd' powershell script for quick access to different folders in a common project. 
Have config to set the root directory, and maybe names for a few main folders within that you want 
quick access to. Oh, and allow other folders outside of the project heirarchy too (e.g. my eviltobz 
git repo). Have some fuzzy matching on a supplied arg so it'll go straight to a folder that it 
matches. If it's listing the folders, have the number to select, but also allow text and the fuzzy
matching again.
